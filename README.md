# CNotepad
A GUI Notepad completely made from scratch using C++ native library and Graphics library coupled with mouse events

##Introduction
CNotepad is a very simple application which I had development during my Highschool(12th) Grade Project as part of the courseWork
It has been lying in my mails for more than 3 years and I would now love to opensource the project for everyone.
So First of all I would like to thank to my High school Teacher, Mrs. Aswathy for her overwhelming support for this project 

##Main Headers used in the project 
Following headers were used for the development of the project
```
#include<string.h>
#include<fstream.h>
#include<process.h>
#include<graphics.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<dos.h>
```
##Features
So this application doesn't have any advance features but plain functions and usage of graphics headers for having a plain UI 
which is minimal and effective and as well as simple to understand. This uses Binary file operations for making files and reading
it.
 * Binary File Operations
 * Open Files
 * Read Files 
 * Edit Files 
 * Details of every file like no of words, letters, paragraph's etc.
 * Customisation of 
  * Background 
  * Text Field
  * Diffrent panels

##Bugs
There are few issues as this is a very early implementation of it.
 * Cannot Edit the notes directly always as it is a binary file may face issues at times.
 * Have few GUI issues of wrong constraints and frames 
 * The Customisation settings are temporary and it is not saved when the application is closed
 * Sometimes when you input files it may be going out of frame of the notepad UI as I have_not 
 found a proper solution to fix it
